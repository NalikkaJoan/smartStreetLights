                Smart Street Lights is a project that deals with the intelligent control of illumination of the streets during the off peak hours in night (from 10.30pm to 5.30am say) based on detection of movement on the road by vehicles (mostly) and pedestrians (if any). Smart Street Lights is a real time automatic control of the intensity of LED Street lights by varying the Voltage across the LED array.
                The inspiration for this project was obtained from the shortage of power in an ever increasing power demand scenario in India. Relevant questions such as, &quot;What can be done in order to reduce the deficit of power?&quot; <q>Is setting up of more power plants the only solution for the problem?</q> <q>Do DSM and other power management techniques provide lasting results?</q> <q>Or is it sensible and feasible to set up an autonomous system that can manage its own power consumptions?</q> cropped up. Though there are several power management techniques such as smart grid technology, home automation technology, that are in place to reduce wastage of power, it was intriguing to find out that there is no such system in place for street lights which are switched on for almost 12hrs or more daily. Though there is an automatic switching facility to switch on the street lights at dusk and switch off at dawn, it is more of a convenience than an effort to reduce power wastage.
                Some emerging technologies incorporate dimming of LED street lights at midnight and brightening before dawn and eventually switch off at dawn. Though this reduces the power consumption, it is not optimal as it may cause inconvenience to late night travelers. Hence, the idea of Smart Street Lights technology became concrete. Smart Street Lights can be designed in several ways. The design methodology adopted was to reduce power of the system and to optimize it based on cost.
                <br>Energy consumed by the existing system of lighting is high and is most inefficient which can be seen by the 2 points explained below: 
              </p>  
                <ul>
                  <li>The present system has a timer for switching on/off of the lights at dawn/dusk which is not that convenient as it may get dark quickly on rainy days/wet season which is drawback of the timer system.</li>
                  <li>As it is powered throughout the night when pedestrian/vehicle movement is least, a lot of power is wasted.</li>
                </ul>
                
                
            <p>
                Street lighting shouldn&#39;t be that bad.

                Smart street lights is a project on intelligent illumination control of street lights to optimize the problem of power consumption and illumination of the streets, late in the night. Street lights today are being replaced by LED street lighting system, which reduces the power consumption. The other advantage of LED is that the intensity can be controlled easily. Hence, movement detection based street light control can be designed easily.
